You  must  design  an  application  to  manage  a  Database  using  OOP 
concepts  and  Singleton,  and  you  must  ensure  only  one  instance  exists, 
capable of managing a simple JSON-style database. This class should also 
include user authentication to ensure that only one authenticated user can 
interact  with  database  at  a  time.  Implement  CRUD  (Create,  Read, 
Update, Delete) operations along with search functionalities to search by 
title, timestamp, and keyword. The database should use a JSON file. 
* You need to Implement a logging class that will log each operation for 
you. 
 :) Good Luck   
 
Keyword to search: 
Data classes and field 
Singleton 
__new__ and itâ€™s use cases 
Timestamps 
Logging => take a look at Real Python ;)
